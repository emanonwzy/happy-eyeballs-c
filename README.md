#  Simple C implementation of RFC-6555 (Happy Eyeballs)

This is an implementation of the Happy Eyeballs algorithm from [rfc6555].

The aim is to provide a (almost) drop-in replacement to the standard [`connect`(3)]
system call, so it can be used in the Example loop from [`getaddrinfo`(3)], for
ease of integration in existing projects.


## Get it

The [authoritative source for this project can be found
here](https://scm.narf.ssji.net/git/happy-eyeballs-c/), but [a mirror is
maintained in sync on GitHub](https://github.com/shtrom/happy-eyeballs-c).
You can clone the latest version with either

    git clone https://scm.narf.ssji.net/git/happy-eyeballs-c

or

    git clone https://github.com/shtrom/happy-eyeballs-c


## Try it

Just run

    make test

to build and run various combinations of tests (pay attention to the names of
the binaries, as well as the amount of time elapsed).


## Use it

As stated above, the aim is to have to make as few changes as possible in the
Example GAI loop. Here's a diff between `gai.c` and `happy.c` at the time
of this writing.

## TODO

* Review and (maybe) implement [rfc8305];
* Make this an actual library with autoconf and all.
